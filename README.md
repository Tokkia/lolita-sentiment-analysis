# Lolita Sentiment Analysis
## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This project conducts a comprehensive sentiment analysis of reader reviews to extract reader opinions on Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel "Lolita". By leveraging advanced data science techniques such as web scraping, NLP, ML, and data visualization, insights were uncovered into the polarizing reactions to this novel.


### 1.2 Problem Resolution ????????
[Describe what problems are resolved by your project]
This project worked to address several key challenges:
1. Effective ways to quantify subjectivity in literary opinon: Through applying sentiment analysis to almost 50k Goodreads reviews, the qualitative data is transformed into quantitative insights.
2. Extraction of meaningful patterns/conclusions from unstructured/uncleaned text data: Through the application of NLP techniques and clustering algorithms, unapparent underlying patterns in reader responses can be revealed.
