# Lolita Sentiment Analysis
## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This project conducts a comprehensive sentiment analysis of reader reviews to extract reader opinions on Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel "Lolita". By leveraging advanced data science techniques such as web scraping, NLP, ML, and data visualization, insights were uncovered into the polarizing reactions to this novel.

### 1.2 Problem Resolution
This project worked to address several key challenges:
1. Effectively quantifying literary opinion through applying sentiment analysis to 50k Goodreads reviews.
2. Extraction of patterns/conclusions from unstructured/uncleaned text data through the application of NLP techniques and clustering algorithms.

### 1.3 Learnings/Skills Developed
Main learnings from this project:
1. Literary analysis: Taught me data-driven approaches to analyzing reader reception to works of literature with the use of traditional analysis methods.
2. Data Visualization Techniques: Taught me various visualization techniques, and how to analyze the data based off visualizations.
3. Sentiment Analysis Techniques: Application and analysis of data cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, hierarchical clustering, logistic regression and k-means clustering.
4. Controversial Topic Handling: How to approach objective analysis given polarizing opinions. Such approaches are applicable to other fields, such as market research, social media analysis, news, and public opinion analysis.
5. Project Workflow: This project demonstrates a complete data analysis project workflow, starting from data collection/cleaning to preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. 



## 2 Installation/Quick Start Guide
To view the code/visualizations used in the final project report:
1. Download all .csv and .ipynb files from the repository.
2. Open JupyterNotebook, and upload all files into a Notebook. 
3. Run all kernels, starting from the first one.



## 3 Demonstration
### 3.1 Features and Functionality (rename dis)
The general report workflow covers:
1. Data Collection: Goodreads webscraping using BeautifulSoup.
2. Data Cleaning: Language detection to filter non-English reviews, text cleaning (removing stopwords, tokenization, lemmatization, typo correction using NLTK).
3. Vectorization: Converted the raw text into vectors using TF-IDF. 
4. Visualizations: Analyzed bar charts, heatmaps, and word clouds.
5. Supervised Learning Technique: Analysis of data after applying logistic regression and creating a confusion matrix.
6. Unsupervised Learning Technique: Applied K-Means Clustering using the Elbow method and VADER, then visualized the results and analyzed them.
